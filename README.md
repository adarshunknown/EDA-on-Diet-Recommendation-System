# EDA-on-Diet-Recommendation-System
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a Diet Recommendation System using real-world data. The goal is to analyze user information (such as age, gender, BMI, activity level, and health conditions) and recommend a personalized diet plan.

It combines data analysis and machine learning models to provide intelligent dietary suggestions for users to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
